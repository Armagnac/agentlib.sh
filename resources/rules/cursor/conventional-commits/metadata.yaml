tagline: Enforce conventional commit message format
description: |
  This rule ensures all commit messages follow the Conventional Commits
  specification, making changelogs and versioning easier to manage.
  It helps maintain a clean and structured git history.
problem_it_solves: |
  Inconsistent commit messages make it hard to understand project history,
  generate changelogs, and determine semantic version bumps automatically.
